This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in loops. The bug is explained in the bug.cob file, and a solution is provided in bugSolution.cob.  The error occurs because the loop condition (I > 10) is checked after the loop body has executed.  This leads to an extra iteration. The solution corrects this by changing the condition to (I >= 10).
